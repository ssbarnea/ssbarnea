## Hi, I'm Sorin ðŸ‘‹

### I work on [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible) DevTools team at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com)

- ðŸ”­ Major projects I am working on [Visual Studio Code Extension for Ansible](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible), [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) and [molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently maintaining several [open source projects](https://sbarnea.com/about/)
- ðŸ’¬ ``@ssbarnea`` nick on matrix channels as [`#ansible-devtools`](https://chat.ansible.im/#/room/#devtools:ansible.com) or [`#pycontribs`](https://app.element.io/#/room/#pycontribs:matrix.org)

### Credits

I would like to thanks everyone that has aver supported me in my volutary work of supporting open-source project. I should mention at least few of these:

* [Red Hat (IBM)](https://redhat.com), which is also my employer, for giving me the freedom to contribute to whatever open-source project I do see fit while at work. In fact I suspect that 98% of what I do for work is on the public internet.
* Every other open-source maintainer which ever reviewed my contributions, or just replied to issues I raise. I do value your help!
* Those that decided to show appeciation by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/ssbarnea). Keep in mind that I donate 100% of what I receive to upstream opensource projects that I use.
* Several companies that found a way to support my work:
  * [1Password](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source) for helping open-souce projects to manage and share secrets
  * [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) for providing me with a free license of the great PyCharm
  * [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com) for giving me a license of their powerful database development tool
  * [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) for providing a free cloud instance of Jira that is used to perform integrations testing on jira python library.

### Updates

- 2022-07: My team started a [menthorship program](https://github.com/ansible/devtools/wiki/mentoring) for those interested in learning how to become good open-source contributors and maintainers.
- 2021-06: Leaving OpenStack and moving to Ansible DevTools team! Now maintaining those cool Ansible developemt tools became my job.
- 2020-12: This year proved to be a very stressful year which got me very close to a burnout. One measure that I had to take was to suspend my maintenance of jira library. I am aware that it is affected by a lot of bitrot and nobody was willing to spend the considerable amount of time needed to restore the CI.

Please do not get offeended if I do not reply to support questions on irc or email. Unless I already know you as someone that contributed to one of projects I maintain or just use, I would likely ignore direct messages.


## Tool others made and that I want to share with you

* [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) for benchmarking command execution times
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching locally. It recognizes gitignores and provide a very useful output. I do also have an alias for it `rg='rg --hidden --no-follow --max-columns 255 --no-heading --column -F'`
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) install and use multiple versions of python. Useful to bring python versions that your distro may lack. Especialy useful for MacOS.
* [direnv](https://direnv.net/) which allows you to create `.envrc` fiels on disk which are automatically loaded. You can put env vars there, including secrets in order to avoid cluttering your entire user profile. This also limits their availability based on where you run from.
* [glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/) and [htop](https://htop.dev/) as alternatives to old `top`.
